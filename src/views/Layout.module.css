/* We need to ensure content is clickable. The overlay puts a tint over the background image but wraps content.
   If we put scanlines on .overlay, it will affect .content visibility potentially.
   Actually, scanlines are usually on top of everything.
   Let's make a separate scanline div or keep it subtle on the background overlay.
   The current structure is Layout -> container -> overlay -> content.
   If overlay has scanlines, content inside might be hard to read or unaffected depending on z-index.
   Since content is IN overlay, the background of overlay is behind content.
   So this is fine for "background scanlines".
   If we want "foreground scanlines", we need a sibling to content.
   I'll stick to background scanlines for now.
